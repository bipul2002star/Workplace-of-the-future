## Description

###### Problem: 
In the post-covid world, we expect many (even non-tech) companies to move on from office workplaces to hybrid workplaces â€“ ones where a significant portion of the employees will work from home (permanently or partially). This shift brings many challenges to the everyday operations of the company and teams and we would like you to address them!

###### Challenge:
create a solution that will help make this workplace of the future not only feasible but also efficient and an equally good alternative to office-only workplaces.


###### COVID19 and the digital hybrid office
After the onset of the pandemic many companies have gone remote. With lockdown imposed, companies shifted to a work from home model or a partial work from home setup.
A hybrid workplace is becoming the "next normal".
John Macomber, senior lecturer of business administration at Harvard business school estimated that COVID-19 has accelerated the acceptability of working from home by 20 years.
Now that we know hybrid workplaces would be the future what can be done?

###### Solution proposed:
**Leveraging platforms like Discord, Slack, MS teams etc**.
Companies can shift to *virtual work places-like discord*. We have made a sample server to demonstrate it. Once a popular communication platform typically for gamers, Discord can be integrated and used as a medium of communication for official work, video conferencing, meetings and also for informal talks with other employees.
Why to use Discord. Why not build some new Video Conferencing App?
The answer is simple- **WHY TO REINVENT THE WHEEL**

1. Discord is easy to set up.
*One can sign up for an account, create a office server, invite colleagues, start conversing and building things in a couple of minutes. Discord supports multiple text and audio channels allowing to split conversation down by team or project.*

2.It is almost free.
*The free version is more or less complete*

3.People can also leverage the persistent audio *which is perfect for coworking, asking for help from the co-workers when needed. It also has
video calls and screen sharing options.*

Several channels can be created like- *finance, marketing, IT, Operations,Human Resource(HR) etc*
Bots can also be added or created such as -*Statbot - server stats bot; Zita - reaction role bot; Apollo- scheduling bot; Helper GG - ticketing bot;Poll bot advanced-*


**Incentive and Reward System and scratch card system**

As people work remotely companies would save on their electricity bills and other maintenance costs. Who doesn't like gifts. The best performing employees can be awarded with vouchers and scratch cards.
This would motivate and incentivise the employees and keep their moral high. Basically the code has been pushed in the repository.

**ML algorithm for Hybrid Office**
The fear of contracting the virus will always be there in the people's mind. No one knows when mankind would get over this. Social distancing is the new normal and hybrid office ,the future. Employees would still have to go to the officers on few occasions.Employees would want a live count of people at any given time in the office to make informed decisions and respect social distancing. Using deep learning and image processing we predict live count of people present in the office.



###### Value of the Solution:
The solutions are very practical and easy to implement. Making a discord server with bots is snappy. 
Scratch Card system to reward best performing employees is motivating and will bring the best from the employees and colleagues. 

As far as the ML model is concerned, no new costly hardware investment is required for the deployment as it leverages  already installed cameras. The problem that the machine learning algorithm solves is very crucial in the present time and for the hybrid offices to come up.

###### Target User:
Office Employees, Companies, etc. The model can also be used in schools and universities.

## Protoype

*There is a discord server dedicated to the hybrid workplaces. The implementation and uses are self explanatory.*


*There is scratch card system to reward the best performing employees.
The employee will need to login with his official credentials and then has to unfrul the scratch card and redeem it.*

*As far as the ML algorithm is concerned, no new hardware investment is required. The model makes use of the office's live footage that is available. Using deep learning and image processing, live count of colleagues is predicted.*

## How to try

*Here is the link to our video of the working prototype: https://youtu.be/biD4MAPsn0U
There is a pdf file in the repository which explains the workflow.

## Challenges and accomplishments

*We learned about bots in discord. We are new to this platform and the bots part of it is really cool *

*We also learned to leverage the open-cv module for image processing along with numpy and we also explored cloud services and using wolfram  one API*

## Next steps

*As far as the server is concerned, integrating the bots according to need can be done. The scratch card system has to be linked with the companies' database for authentication purposes.*

*The live count machine learning model has to be deployed on the cloud and it has to be made available as API via wolfram one for training and increasing accuracy purposes.*
